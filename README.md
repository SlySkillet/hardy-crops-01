### The goals of this project are to:
1. illustrate the viability of common garden crops for each of the USDA Plant Hardiness Zones
2. demonstrate the integration of spatial data as a custom layer in a Mapbox instance
3. demonstrate use of map geometries as programmable, interactive features of a user interface

### Built with:
- React-TS
- Vite
- MapboxGl
- TailwindCSS
